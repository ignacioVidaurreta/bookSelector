# The Book Wizard

This simple script was made for personal use. Right now I have a lot of books I would like to read and I don't know which one to read, so I made this script that selects a book randomly from a file that contains every title in consideration (see bookList.wtr to understand the format that file must have to be read correctly). This script was also a bit of an excuse to practice my Python skills.

# Compatibility

The script was made to work with Python 2.x, since it uses raw_input
